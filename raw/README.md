In my opinion does "zombie" hordes and team work better than left 4 dead plus has a global leveling system. Alot of down to earth "zombie" splattering fun for the whole family.

The gunplay can be a bit chunky at times but at the end of the day this game is definitely worth it and I hope they do a sequel...so buy the game so I get a sequel!'}]}

You don\'t get any of that cliche game mechanics that all the latest games have, this is simply good core gameplay. Yes, you can\'t 360 noscope your friends, but what you can do is show them up with your bad ♥♥♥ dance moves and put them to shame as you show them what true fashion and color combinations are.I know this game says for kids but, this is easily for any age range and any age will have a blast playing this.8/8'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted September 8, 2013.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '227300', 'helpful': '0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': "For a simple (it's actually not all that simple but it can be!) truck driving Simulator, it is quite a fun and relaxing game. Playing on simple (or easy?) its just the basic WASD keys for driving but (if you want) the game can be much harder and realistic with having to manually change gears, much harder turning, etc. And reversing in this game is a ♥♥♥♥♥, as I imagine it would be with an actual truck. Luckily, you don't have to reverse park it but you get extra points if you do cause it is bloody hard. But this is suprisingly a nice truck driving game and I had a bit of fun with it."}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted November 29, 2013.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '239030', 'helpful': '1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Very fun little game to play when your bored or as a time passer. Very gud. Do Recommend. pls buy'}]}
